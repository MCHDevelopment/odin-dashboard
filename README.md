I know there is still a lot that could (and should) be improved, there are certainly many css rules that could be condensed, I overused the grid layout to make the most of this assignment, and I am sure there are areas that could have been styled otherwise. The Buttons don't look like they are supposed to, there are some margins and paddings that are off, the links could use some work and maybe it would have been better to stick with the provided design, but I will leave it that way (for now, maybe forever) to continue with the Javascript part. I just tried to get as close to the provided layout as possible and practise the Grid Layout and I consider those two goals achieved.
